`mcdm` is a Rust library to assist with solving Multiple-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problems. It provides a comprehensive set of tools for decision analysis, including normalization techniques, weighting methods, and ranking algorithms.

## ‚ú® Features

MCDM involves evaluating multiple conflicting criteria when making decisions. This library aims to provide various techniques to normalize data, assign weights to criteria, and rank alternatives. Below is a list of the components that have been implemented.

### üîÑ Normalization

Normalization ensures that criteria with different units of measurement can be compared on a common scale. Each method has a specific use case depending on the decision problem.

| üåü Name               | üìù Description |
| :----------------: | :---------: |
| Enhanced Accuracy  | Technique proposed by Zeng and Yang in 2013 incorporating criterion's minimums and maximums into the computation. |
| Linear 			 | Similiar to Max normalization, where profit criteria depend on the critions maximum value and cost criteria depend on criterion minimum value. |
| Logarithmic        | Uses natural logarithm in the normalization. |
| Min-Max | Scales the values of each criterion between 0 and 1 (or another range) by using the minimum and maximum values of that criterion. |
| Max                | Similiar to MinMax, but here each element is divided by the maximum value in the column |
| Nonlinear | Similiar to linear normalization, but relies on exponentiation of the criteria to help capture more complexitities in the criteria or when data distributions are skewed. |
| Sum				 | Uses the sum of each alternatives criterion. |
| Vector             | Considers the root of the sum of squares for each criterion. |
| Zavadskas-Turskis  | Convert different criteria into comparable units. |
|  |  |

### ‚öñÔ∏è Weighting

Weights reflect the relative importance of each criterion. Different weighting techniques help balance criteria appropriately in the decision-making process.

| üìä Name               | üìù Description |
| :----------------: | :---------: |
| Angular | Measures angle between each criterion and an ideal point in a multidimensional space. Criteria that are closer to that ideal point (i.e., have smaller angles) are considered more important and assigned higher weights. |
| CRiteria Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation (CRITIC) |Determines weights by combining the variability (standard deviation) of each criterion and the correlation between criteria. A criterion with high variablity and low correlation with others is considered more important. |
| Entropy			 | Measures the uncertainty or disorder within the criterion's values across alternatives. Criteria with higher variability (i.e., more dispersed values) have higher entropy and are assigned lower weights. Criteria with more structured values receive higher weights. |
| Equal              | Assumes all criteria are equally important and each criterion is assigned the same weight. |
| Gini | Based on the Gini coefficient, which measures inequality or dispersion. Criteria with greaterinequality or larger variation across alternatives receive higher weights. |
| Method Based on the Removal Effects of Criiteria (MEREC) | Evaluates how the absence of a criterion affects the overall decision. Criteria that, when removed, significantly change the ranking of alternatives are considered more important and are given higher weights. |
| Standard Deviation | Criteria weights are derived from standard deviation of criteria across alternatives. Criteria with hiigher standard deviation (i.e., more variation) are given higher weights because they better differentiate the alternatives.
| Variance | Similiar to standard deviation, variance weighting assigns weights to criteria based on the dispersion (variance) of their values across alternatives. Criter with higher variance are consideredmore important. |

### üìà Ranking Methods

Ranking algorithms combine normalized data and weights to determine the best alternative. These methods aim to provide a clear ranking of alternatives based on the decision-maker's preferences.

| ü•á Name               | üìù Description |
| :----------------: | :---------: |
| Additive Ratio ASsessment (ARAS) | Assesses alternatives by comparing their overall performance to the ideal (best) alternative. The assessment is made by taking the ratio of the normalized and weighted decision matrix to the normalized and weighted "best case" alternatives.
| COmbined COmpromise SOlution (COCOSO) | Combines aspects of compromise ranking methods to evaluate and rank alternatives by integrating three approaches: simple additive weighting (SAW), weighted product model (WPM), and the average ranking of alternatives based on their relative performance. This method finds a compromise solution by blending these different ranking strategies, making it robust in handling conflicting criteria. |
| COmbined Distance-based ASessment (CODAS) | Ranks alternatives based on euclidean distance and taxicab distance from the negative ideal solution. |
| COmplex PRoportional ASsessment (COPRAS) | Ranks alternatives by separately considering the effects of maximizing (beneficial) and minimizing (non-beneficial) index values of attributes. |
| Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS) | Ranks alternatives based on how alternatives are evaluated with respct to their distance from the mean solution. |
| Election based on Relative Value Distances (ERVD) | Ranks alternatives based on the distance each alternative is from a value decision which represents a positive or negative ideal solution.
| Multi-Attributive Border Approximation Area Comparison (MABAC) | A compensatory ranking method that allows for the trade-off between criteria. The general approach is to calculate the distance between each alternative and an ideal solution called the "border approximation area". |
| Multi-Attributive Ideal-Real Comparative Analysis (MAIRCA) | Ranking method designed to rank alternatives based on their relative closeness to an ideal solution and distance form a real comparative solution. |
| Measurement of Alternatives and Ranking according to COmpromise Solutions (MARCOS) | Designed to rank alternatives of a non-normalized decision matrix based on their performance across multiple criteria. It combines normalization, ideal solutions, and compromise approaches to evaulate alternatives. |
| Multi-Objective Optimization on the basis of Ratio Analysis (MOORA) | Ranking method that ranks alternatives based on multiple conflicting criteria. |
| Operational Competitiveness Rating Analysis (OCRA) | The OCRA ranking method operates on a non-normalized decision matrix. This method ranks alternatives by comparing their performance across multiple criteria. It is designed to handle both beneficial critieria (those to be maximized, such as profits or quality) and non-beneficial criteria (those to be minimized, such as costs or environmental impact). |
| Preference Ranking on the Basis of Ideal-Average Distance (PROBID) | Ranks alternatives based on their proximity to an ideal solution while considering average performance of alternatives. |
| Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS)          |   Conceptually says the best alternative should have the shortest geometric distance from the postivei ideal solution and the longest distance form the negative ideal solution.  |
| Weighted Product Model | Ranks alternatives based on product of each weighted alternative. |
| Weighted Sum | Ranks alternatives based on the weighted sum of the alternatives criteria values. |

### üß™ Example

Here‚Äôs an example demonstrating how to use the mcdm library for decision-making with the TOPSIS method:

```rust
use mcdm::{
    errors::McdmError, normalization::Normalize, ranking::Rank, weighting::Weight, CriteriaType,
};
use nalgebra::dmatrix;

fn main() -> Result<(), McdmError> {
    // Define the decision matrix (alternatives x criteria)
    let alternatives = dmatrix![4.0, 7.0, 8.0; 2.0, 9.0, 6.0; 3.0, 6.0, 9.0];
    let criteria_types = CriteriaType::from(vec![-1, 1, 1])?;

    // Apply normalization using Min-Max
    let normalized_matrix = alternatives.normalize_min_max(&criteria_types)?;

    // Alternatively, use equal weights
    let equal_weights = normalized_matrix.weight_equal()?;

    // Apply the TOPSIS method for ranking
    let ranking = normalized_matrix.rank_topsis(&equal_weights)?;

    // Output the ranking
    println!("Ranking: {:.3}", ranking);

    Ok(())
}
```
